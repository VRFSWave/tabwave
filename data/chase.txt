----Lyrics----
Here we were and here we are
We're living high and living fast
Out from the hole where we used to be
I wanna take a car or a plane
And find a door to make my name
Cause I need to know how
What do you mean
No you tell me
I think I need
A source of action
Oh I dunno I don't need it
Go ahead and bring it on down
I thought too long, now I need it
Go ahead and bring it on down
This sensation
In temptation
Got me spinning around and round
I will chase ya
If I face ya
I need a savior
Here we were and here we are
We're living high and living fast
Out from the hole where we used to be
I wanna take a car or a plane
And find a door to make my name
Cause I need to know how
So, what do you mean
No you tell me
I think I need
A source of action
Oh I dunno I don't need it
Go ahead and bring it on down
I thought too long, now I need it
Go ahead and bring it on down
This sensation
In temptation
Got me spinning around and round
I will chase ya
If I face ya
I need a savior
So, what do you mean
No you tell me
I think I need
A source of action
Oh I dunno I don't need it
Go ahead and bring it on down
I thought too long, now I need it
Go ahead and bring it on down
This sensation
In temptation
Got me spinning around and round
I will chase ya
If I face ya
I need a savior
